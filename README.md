Grading
The breakdown is subject to change as a whole and adjustments on a per-student basis in exceptional cases. This is the general breakdown we'll be using:

Programming Assignments:	48%
Midterm:	12%
Final:	40%
Programming assignments are done individually.

Midterm and final are closed-book-closed-notes exams.

Programming Assignments:
CS 4901J is taught using the Lab 4 (4210) consisting of roughly 65 Windows workstations with GPU support. The lab can be reached by lift 19.
There will be four programming assignments.

Assignment #1:
Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Neural Network
Assignment #2:
Fully-Connected Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Convolutional Nets
Assignment #3:
Image Captioning, Network Visualization, Style Transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks
Assignment #4:
Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradient, Model Network
You will have three weeks for each programming assignment.
